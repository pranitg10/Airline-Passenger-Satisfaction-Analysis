# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Review Analysis

This analysis reveals key trends and offers recommendations for airlines to improve their services. I used EDA & Tableau to analyze airline passenger satisfaction reviews. I looked at factors like service quality to see how things like seat comfort, food, and entertainment affect satisfaction. 

### Project Overview

This project explores airline passenger satisfaction by analyzing various factors such as service quality, seat comfort, food, and in-flight entertainment. Using Python for data cleaning and visualization, along with Tableau for dashboarding, we identify key trends and areas for improvement to enhance the overall flight experience.

### Problem Statement

Airlines face challenges like declining passenger numbers and poor service, which impact revenue and brand reputation. By analyzing factors affecting passenger satisfaction, this project aims to uncover drivers of satisfaction and provide actionable recommendations to improve service quality.

### Data Overview

- Dataset: Passenger satisfaction data from an airline (Emirates), with 130,000 passengers
- Features Analyzed: Age, gender, class (Business, Economy, Economy Plus), and various service quality metrics
- Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and visualization
- Tableau for creating interactive dashboards

### Key Steps

### Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values and outliers (e.g., departure/arrival delays, age)
Visualizations using box plots and histograms to better understand distributions

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Data Loading:**

Loaded the dataset using Pandas for further analysis.

**Data Cleaning:**

1. Identified and handled missing values, specifically in the Arrival Delay column, filling missing entries with the mean value.
2. Treated outliers in numerical columns such as:
- Departure Delay (13.9%)
- Arrival Delay (13.4%)

**Visualization:**
1. Generated histograms to understand the distribution of variables like Arrival Delay and identify potential anomalies.
2. This section outlines the key steps of your EDA, focusing on data cleaning and handling outliers, as well as some initial visualizations. Let me know if you'd like any other modifications!

### Key Insights:
1. Ease of online booking, food, and cleanliness were rated lowest across all classes.
2. Business class had the highest satisfaction, but areas like legroom and check-in still need improvement.

### Recommendations:

1. Streamline the booking process to improve user experience.
2. Enhance food offerings, cleanliness, and in-flight services to meet customer expectations.

### Results

The analysis provided clear insights into passenger satisfaction drivers, helping airlines identify critical areas to enhance service and improve customer retention.

### Conclusion

By focusing on key service aspects like online booking and in-flight services, airlines can significantly improve customer satisfaction and strengthen brand loyalty.
